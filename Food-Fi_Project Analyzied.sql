-- 											* Data Analysis Questions *
-- 1.) How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM subscriptions;

-- 2.) What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
SELECT MONTH(start_date) AS Month_Num, MONTHNAME(start_date) AS Month_Name, COUNT(plan_id) AS Trial_Count
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 0
GROUP BY Month_Num, Month_Name
ORDER BY Trial_Count DESC;

-- 3.) What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name
SELECT plan_name, sub.plan_id, COUNT(start_date) AS Num_Of_Subscription
FROM subscriptions sub 
JOIN plans pla 
	ON sub.plan_id = pla.plan_id
WHERE YEAR(start_date) > 2020
GROUP BY sub.plan_id, plan_name

 (SELECT (CONCAT(ROUND((COUNT(customer_id) / 1000) * 100, 1), '%')) FROM subscriptions WHERE plan_id = 4) AS Percentage
FROM subscriptions;

-- 5.) How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?
SELECT COUNT(customer_id) AS Num_Customers, CONCAT(ROUND(((COUNT(customer_id) / 1000) * 100)), '%') AS Percentage_Count
FROM (
	SELECT customer_id, plan_name, LEAD(plan_name) OVER() AS Next_Plan

CONCAT(ROUND(((COUNT(customer_id) / 1000) * 100)), '%') AS Percentage_Count
FROM (

	WHERE start_date <= '2020-12-31') AS Finder
WHERE Ranked = 1
GROUP BY plan_name
ORDER BY Cust_Count DESC;

-- 8.) How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS Customer_Count
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 3 AND YEAR(start_date) = 2020;

-- 9.) How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
SELECT ROUND(AVG(Dayer)) AS Avg_Day
FROM (
